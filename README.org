** Introduction

This program can be used to generate arbitrary L-systems. It supports:
+ full rewriting rules
+ full representation rules
+ personalized angle and segment length for the representation
+ push ('[') and pop (']') operations

** ~LSystem~ data type

An L-system consists of:
+ the L-system itself:
  + an alphabet
  + an axiom (i.e. the starting point)
  + a set of rewriting rules (represented as a list of tuples)
+ rules to transform it into a graphical representation:
  + an angle and a length
  + a set of representation rules (which symbols mean "draw forward",
    "turn left", "pop a position", etc.)

** Building and running

You will need [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/][Stack]].

From the repository, run:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
stack build
stack exec lsystems-exe
#+END_SRC

This will open a window, where you can move around using the mouse and
zoom by scrolling.

For tests and documentation, run:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
stack test --haddock
#+END_SRC

** Implementation

The program is implemented in Haskell, using [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss][Gloss]] to display the
generated L-systems.
